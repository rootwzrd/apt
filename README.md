apt
======

## Very, very Alpha!

apt is like npm, but for Linux sources. apt can maintain per-project dependencies,

# Example

    # View available modules
    apt.search(); # terminal> apt search

    # Install a module
    apt install mysql; # terminal> apt install mysql

    # View installed modules
    apt view; # terminal> apt view
